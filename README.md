# Opioids
This repository (My Current Project!) contains analysis of opioid prescribers in the USA
My goal is to predict which medical professionals would be considered "opioid prescriber's" based on features such as gender, degree, and a list of different prescribed pharmaceuticals. 

I hope to then merge these with other analysis of an overdose database...
